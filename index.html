            From another year of top Super Bowl spots and award-winning projects to launching our new website and joining the Technicolor family, 2015 has been another fantastic year across The Mill. We’re taking a look back at many of the big projects, wins and news that made our 2015 great. We've also included the reels, title sequences and behind the scenes films created this year.

                                The year was filled with award-winning projects and recognition for the breadth of quality work being produced across studios. We were honoured to receive Post-Production Company of the Year at the LIAs, while also topping the annual Televisual Facilities 50 survey for an unprecedented seven years in row.

            The Mill in London also won Top Rated and Top Used Post Production Company of the Year in the 2015 Televisual Commercials 30, with four Mill artists included in Top Operators: Andrew Wood (Barnsley), Creative Director; Seamus O'Kane, Head of Colour; Dave 'Luddy' Ludlam, Colourist; and Matt Osborne, Colourist.

                                Mill+ Designer Aran Quinn directed the 2015 Title Sequence for OFFSET London, the international debut for the Dublin-based design and creative conference featuring the makers, innovators and educators shaping the future of our visual landscape.
                            </p>
                            <p>
            For OFFSET’s first international conference, Aran created a title sequence following six characters from across the globe en route to the festival in London. While travelling on their very own custom made motorbikes, each character is carrying an individual letter to spell out 'OFFSET'. Along the way, they each leave a unique trail that transforms to spell out the names of the 18 guest speakers.

                                Each character was made out of clay and hand painted four times or more to create a boiling or flickering effect, which was inspired by a technique by fellow Irish artist Conor Finnegan. All of the characters’ background props and the speakers’ names are cell animated and designed to reflect the local culture of each quirky globetrotter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
            Aran comments, “I love stop motion and cell animation so I went straight for mixed media approach as it’s my most favorable technique. It also ties into the speakers’ different backgrounds in multidisciplinary work since the OFFSET festival covers all areas of identity projects, graphics, print, animation, film and illustration."

                                ‘HELP’ combines live action and CG in a 360 environment, creating an action-driven story with cinematic quality visual effects. The team worked to solve the technical and creative challenges involved with immersive and VR filmmaking, developing a custom 360 camera rig solution with the ability to follow the action.
                            </p>
                            <p>
            Shooting 360 live action footage has generally been a challenge for directors, with most methods providing images from multiple cameras with an overlapping wide-angle field of view. The Mill took on the challenge to build a comprehensive onset/dailies type solution that was intuitive and inspired confidence on set.

                                After numerous tests, experimentation and R&D, The Mill developed ‘Mill Stitch’ (TM pending), a proprietary software solution that takes images from multiple cameras and then stitches the output into a continuous 360 degree view. Mill Stitch proved invaluable to the process, bringing real-time stitching, interactive controls, and record/review to a cinematic VR production pipeline. Mill Stitch was even featured at Google I/O sandbox so patrons could experience first hand what it would be like directing a VR film.

            The film features a montage of numerous clips from classics to cult favourites and contemporary cinema; referencing the BFI’s role in supporting emerging British talent and film culture as a whole. The concept behind the fundraising film plays on the idea that stories, not just films, deserve to be preserved; encouraging the viewer to imagine their favourite films literally being burnt before their very eyes.

We are very grateful for the filmmakers, whose generosity helped us create this film; allowing us to pay testament to the worthy cause that the BFI are promoting. It was like piecing together a giant jigsaw puzzle using footage from some of the best films in British cinema. Our talented design team then got to work on coming up with the correct film burn language.”
