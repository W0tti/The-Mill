                                Mill+ Designer Aran Quinn directed the 2015 Title Sequence for OFFSET London, the international debut for the Dublin-based design and creative conference featuring the makers, innovators and educators shaping the future of our visual landscape.

            For OFFSET’s first international conference, Aran created a title sequence following six characters from across the globe en route to the festival in London. While travelling on their very own custom made motorbikes, each character is carrying an individual letter to spell out 'OFFSET'. Along the way, they each leave a unique trail that transforms to spell out the names of the 18 guest speakers.

                                Each character was made out of clay and hand painted four times or more to create a boiling or flickering effect, which was inspired by a technique by fellow Irish artist Conor Finnegan. All of the characters’ background props and the speakers’ names are cell animated and designed to reflect the local culture of each quirky globetrotter.

            Aran comments, “I love stop motion and cell animation so I went straight for mixed media approach as it’s my most favorable technique. It also ties into the speakers’ different backgrounds in multidisciplinary work since the OFFSET festival covers all areas of identity projects, graphics, print, animation, film and illustration."
